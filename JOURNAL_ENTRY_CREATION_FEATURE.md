# Journal Entry Creation Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a complete "Create New Journal Entry" feature with file attachment support. Users can now create journal entries directly from the UI with multiple account lines and optional file attachments.

## Changes Made

### 1. Frontend Changes

#### A. New Component: `NewJournalEntryDialog.tsx`
**Location**: `/frontend/src/components/NewJournalEntryDialog.tsx`

Features:
- Modal dialog for creating journal entries
- Entry date selector (defaults to today)
- Entry type checkbox (Regular/Adjusting)
- Description field (optional, multi-line)
- Dynamic account lines table:
  - Default: 1 debit line + 1 credit line
  - Add/remove additional lines
  - Account dropdown populated from active accounts
  - Amount input with validation
  - Real-time debit/credit totals
  - Balance indicator (debits must equal credits)
- File attachment section:
  - Support for multiple files
  - Allowed types: PDF, Word, Excel, CSV, JPG, PNG
  - File preview with size display
  - Remove individual files before upload
- Form validation:
  - Entry date required
  - At least one debit and one credit line
  - All lines must have account and amount > 0
  - Debits must equal credits
- Loading states and error handling

#### B. Updated: `Journalize.tsx`
**Location**: `/frontend/src/pages/Journalize.tsx`

Changes:
- Imported `NewJournalEntryDialog` component
- Added `newEntryOpen` state
- Enabled "New Entry" button (removed `disabled` prop)
- Added `onClick` handler to open dialog
- Added dialog component with success callback to refresh entries

#### C. Updated: `journalEntriesService.ts`
**Location**: `/frontend/src/services/journalEntriesService.ts`

Changes:
- Added `files?: File[]` to `CreateJournalEntryRequest` interface
- Updated `createJournalEntry` method to handle file uploads:
  - Creates FormData instead of JSON
  - Appends entry data and files
  - Sets correct Content-Type header for multipart/form-data

#### D. Updated: `apiClient.ts`
**Location**: `/frontend/src/services/apiClient.ts`

Changes:
- Modified `buildHeaders` to detect FormData
- Removed automatic `Content-Type: application/json` for FormData (browser sets boundary)
- Updated `request` method to handle FormData bodies without JSON.stringify

### 2. Backend Changes

#### A. Updated: `journal_entries.py`
**Location**: `/backend/routes/journal_entries.py`

Added:
- File upload imports: `UploadFile`, `File`, `Form`
- Constants for allowed file types and extensions
- New POST endpoint `create_journal_entry`:
  - Accepts form data with entry details
  - Parses JSON lines data
  - Validates:
    - At least 2 lines (debit + credit)
    - All lines have required fields
    - Amounts are positive
    - Debits equal credits
    - File types are allowed
  - Creates journal entry record
  - Inserts entry lines
  - Uploads files to Supabase Storage bucket
  - Creates attachment records in database
  - Logs creation event
  - Returns complete entry with attachments

File Upload Implementation:
```python
- Bucket name: "journal-attachments"
- File naming: {journal_entry_id}/{uuid}{extension}
- Storage: Supabase Storage with private access
- Metadata: Stored in journalattachments table
```

### 3. Documentation

#### A. New: `JOURNAL_ATTACHMENTS_SETUP.md`
**Location**: `/JOURNAL_ATTACHMENTS_SETUP.md`

Comprehensive guide including:
- Supabase Storage bucket creation instructions
- Security policies for the bucket
- File upload specifications
- Database schema reference
- Usage instructions
- API documentation
- Troubleshooting guide
- Security considerations

## Database Schema

No schema changes required - uses existing `journalattachments` table:
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.journalattachments (
  AttachmentID bigint GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY NOT NULL,
  JournalEntryID bigint NOT NULL,
  FileName text NOT NULL,
  FilePath text NOT NULL,
  FileType text,
  FileSize bigint,
  UploadedByUserID uuid NOT NULL,
  UploadTimestamp timestamp with time zone NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);
```

## Required Supabase Setup

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Before using this feature, create the storage bucket:

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Storage
2. Create new bucket: `journal-attachments` (private)
3. Add storage policies (see JOURNAL_ATTACHMENTS_SETUP.md)

## API Endpoint

### POST `/api/journal-entries`

**Request** (multipart/form-data):
```
entry_date: string (YYYY-MM-DD)
description: string (optional)
is_adjusting_entry: boolean
lines: JSON string (array)
files: File[] (optional)
```

**Response** (JSON):
```json
{
  "journal_entry_id": 123,
  "entry_date": "2025-10-18",
  "description": "Sample entry",
  "status": "Pending",
  "is_adjusting_entry": false,
  "created_by_username": "john_doe",
  "creation_date": "2025-10-18T10:30:00Z",
  "lines": [
    {
      "line_id": 1,
      "account_id": 10,
      "account_number": "1000",
      "account_name": "Cash",
      "type": "Debit",
      "amount": "100.00"
    },
    ...
  ],
  "attachments": [
    {
      "attachment_id": 1,
      "file_name": "receipt.pdf",
      "file_size": 102400,
      "file_type": "application/pdf",
      "uploaded_by_username": "john_doe"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

## User Flow

1. User clicks "New Entry" button on Journalize page
2. Dialog opens with default values:
   - Today's date
   - Regular entry type
   - 1 debit line + 1 credit line
3. User fills in:
   - Entry date (can change)
   - Description (optional)
   - Entry type (toggle adjusting if needed)
   - Account lines (select accounts, enter amounts)
   - Add more lines as needed
   - Attach files (optional)
4. System validates:
   - Real-time balance checking
   - Form validation on submit
   - File type validation
5. On success:
   - Entry created with "Pending" status
   - Files uploaded to Supabase Storage
   - Dialog closes
   - Entries list refreshes
   - New entry appears in table

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Create entry with minimum fields (date + 1 debit + 1 credit)
- [ ] Create adjusting entry
- [ ] Add multiple debit and credit lines
- [ ] Remove lines (ensure minimum maintained)
- [ ] Test balance validation (unbalanced entry should error)
- [ ] Test account dropdown (shows active accounts)
- [ ] Upload single file
- [ ] Upload multiple files (different types)
- [ ] Test invalid file type rejection
- [ ] Remove files before submission
- [ ] View created entry in details dialog
- [ ] Verify attachments appear in details
- [ ] Check event logs for creation event

## Dependencies

All required dependencies already installed:
- Frontend: React, MUI, Axios (built-in)
- Backend: FastAPI, python-multipart, supabase

## Security Features

1. **Authentication Required**: All endpoints require valid JWT token
2. **Private Storage**: Supabase bucket is private, not public
3. **File Type Validation**: Both frontend and backend validate file types
4. **Input Validation**: All form inputs validated before submission
5. **Balance Validation**: Debits must equal credits
6. **User Attribution**: All entries/attachments tracked with user ID
7. **Event Logging**: Creation events logged for audit trail

## Known Limitations

1. File size limits depend on Supabase plan
2. No file preview before upload (shows name and size only)
3. Cannot edit entry after creation (future enhancement)
4. Cannot delete attachments after upload (future enhancement)
5. No virus scanning on uploaded files

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- [ ] Edit existing journal entries
- [ ] Delete/replace attachments
- [ ] File preview (images, PDFs)
- [ ] Direct file download
- [ ] Batch entry creation
- [ ] Entry templates
- [ ] File compression
- [ ] Virus scanning
- [ ] Draft entries (save before balancing)
- [ ] Attachment thumbnails in table view

## Commits Recommended

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add create journal entry feature with file attachments

- Add NewJournalEntryDialog component with dynamic lines and file upload
- Update Journalize page to open creation dialog

## Notes

- The feature requires the Supabase storage bucket to be created manually (one-time setup)
- Files are stored with UUIDs to prevent naming conflicts
- Each journal entry gets its own folder in storage
- All entries start with "Pending" status and require approval
- The system maintains audit trail through event logs
