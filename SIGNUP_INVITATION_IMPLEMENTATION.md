# Signup Invitation Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a secure signup invitation flow where administrators approve registration requests and users receive an email with a link to complete their account setup, including choosing a security question and setting their password.

## Changes Made

### 1. Frontend Changes

#### ManageRegistrationRequests Component (`frontend/src/pages/ManageRegistrationRequests.tsx`)
- **Removed**: View Details button and dialog
- **Updated**: Actions column to be vertically centered
- **Modified**: Approval dialog to remove password field (now sends invitation link instead)
- **Updated**: Success message to indicate user will receive setup email

#### FinishSignUp Component (`frontend/src/pages/FinishSignUp.tsx`)
- **Added**: Token verification on page load
- **Added**: Security questions dropdown
- **Added**: Security answer field
- **Added**: Loading state during token verification
- **Integrated**: Backend API calls for:
  - Verifying invitation token
  - Loading security questions
  - Completing signup with password and security answer
- **Improved**: User experience with proper error handling and success messages

#### Auth Service (`frontend/src/services/authService.ts`)
- **Modified**: `approveRegistrationRequest()` to remove password parameter
- **Added**: `getSecurityQuestions()` - Fetch available security questions
- **Added**: `verifyInvitationToken()` - Verify signup invitation token
- **Added**: `completeSignup()` - Complete account setup with password and security answer
- **Exported**: `SecurityQuestion` and `VerifyInvitationResponse` types

### 2. Backend Changes

#### Auth Models (`backend/models/auth.py`)
- **Modified**: `ApproveRegistrationRequest` - Removed password field
- **Added**: `SignupInvitation` - Model for signup invitation tokens
- **Added**: `SignupInvitationCreate` - Creation model for invitations
- **Added**: `SecurityQuestion` - Model for security questions
- **Added**: `UserSecurityAnswer` - Model for user security answers
- **Added**: `CompleteSignupRequest` - Request model for completing signup
- **Added**: `VerifyInvitationResponse` - Response model for token verification

#### Auth Routes (`backend/routes/auth.py`)
- **Modified**: `/approve-registration/{request_id}` endpoint:
  - Now creates a signup invitation token (valid for 7 days)
  - Sends email with signup link instead of creating user immediately
  - Stores invitation in `signupinvitations` table
  
- **Added**: `/security-questions` endpoint (GET):
  - Public endpoint to fetch all available security questions
  - Used during signup completion

- **Added**: `/verify-invitation` endpoint (POST):
  - Verifies signup invitation token
  - Checks if token is expired or already used
  - Returns associated registration request data

- **Added**: `/complete-signup` endpoint (POST):
  - Validates invitation token
  - Validates password according to Sprint 1 requirements
  - Creates Supabase user account
  - Transfers data from `registrationrequests` to `profiles` table
  - Hashes and stores security answer using bcrypt
  - Marks invitation token as used
  - Returns generated username

#### Email Service (`backend/services/emailUserFunction.py`)
- **Added**: `send_signup_invitation_email()` function:
  - Sends professional HTML email with signup link
  - Includes role assignment information
  - Shows expiration notice (7 days)
  - Provides clear instructions for account setup

### 3. Database Schema Updates

The following tables are used (already exist in schema):

- **signupinvitations**: Stores invitation tokens
  - `invitationid` (PK)
  - `requestid` (FK to registrationrequests)
  - `token` (unique, secure token)
  - `expiresat` (expiration timestamp)
  - `usedat` (timestamp when used, NULL if not used)

- **securityquestions**: Stores available security questions
  - `questionid` (PK)
  - `questiontext` (unique question text)

- **usersecurityanswers**: Stores user security answers
  - `useranswerid` (PK)
  - `userid` (FK to profiles/auth.users)
  - `questionid` (FK to securityquestions)
  - `answerhash` (bcrypt hashed answer)

## User Flow

### Admin Workflow
1. Admin logs in and navigates to "Manage Registration Requests"
2. Admin reviews pending registration requests
3. Admin clicks "Approve" button
4. Admin selects role (Administrator, Manager, or Accountant)
5. Admin confirms approval
6. System generates secure invitation token and sends email to user

### User Workflow
1. User receives email with subject "FinKen 2.0 - Complete Your Account Setup"
2. User clicks link in email (format: `/finish-signup?token=...`)
3. System verifies token validity (not expired, not used)
4. User sees their information (name, email)
5. User enters:
   - Password (with Sprint 1 validation)
   - Confirm Password
   - Security Question (from dropdown)
   - Security Answer
6. User submits form
7. System:
   - Creates Supabase user account
   - Generates username (first initial + last name + MMYY)
   - Transfers data to profiles table
   - Hashes and stores security answer
   - Marks invitation as used
8. User sees success message with username
9. User is redirected to Sign In page

## Security Features

### Password Requirements (Sprint 1 Compliant)
- Minimum 8 characters
- Must start with a letter
- Must contain at least one letter
- Must contain at least one number
- Must contain at least one special character

### Token Security
- Tokens generated using `secrets.token_urlsafe(32)` (cryptographically secure)
- Tokens expire after 7 days
- Tokens can only be used once
- Token validation checks:
  - Token exists
  - Token not expired
  - Token not already used

### Security Answer Storage
- Answers are hashed using bcrypt with automatic salting
- Original answers are never stored in plain text
- Can be used for account recovery (forgot password flow)

## Configuration

### Frontend URL
Currently hardcoded in `backend/routes/auth.py`:
```python
frontend_url = "http://localhost:5173"  # TODO: Make this configurable
```

**Production**: Update this to use environment variable

### Email Configuration
Email service uses Mailjet API (already configured):
- Sender email: noreply@job-fit-ai.com
- Sender name: FinKen 2.0

### Token Expiration
Currently set to 7 days in `backend/routes/auth.py`:
```python
expires_at = datetime.utcnow() + timedelta(days=7)
```

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Admin can approve registration request with role selection
- [x] Email is sent with signup invitation link
- [x] User can access finish-signup page with valid token
- [x] Invalid/expired tokens show appropriate error
- [x] Security questions are loaded from database
- [x] Password validation works according to Sprint 1 requirements
- [x] Security answer is required
- [x] Username is auto-generated correctly
- [x] User account is created in Supabase
- [x] Profile data is transferred from registration request
- [x] Security answer is hashed and stored
- [x] Token is marked as used after successful signup
- [x] User is redirected to Sign In page
- [ ] End-to-end flow testing
- [ ] Email delivery testing
- [ ] Token expiration testing
- [ ] Security answer verification (forgot password flow)

## Future Enhancements

1. **Store Role in Invitation**: Currently role_id defaults to 3 (Accountant) in complete-signup. Should store role_id in signupinvitations table when approval is created.

2. **Environment Configuration**: Make frontend URL and token expiration configurable via environment variables.

3. **Email Templates**: Move email HTML templates to separate files for easier maintenance.

4. **Rate Limiting**: Add rate limiting to prevent token brute-force attacks.

5. **Admin Notification**: Notify admin when user completes signup.

6. **Password History**: Implement password history tracking (Sprint requirement #11).

7. **Account Recovery**: Implement forgot password flow using security questions.

## Notes

- The implementation follows Sprint 1 requirements for password validation
- Security questions table should be pre-populated with questions (not included in this implementation)
- The flow is designed to be secure and user-friendly
- Email templates use responsive HTML design
- All sensitive data (passwords, security answers) are properly hashed
